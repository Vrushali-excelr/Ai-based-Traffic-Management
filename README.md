# Ai-based-Traffic-Management
**Overview**
This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic management system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) for optimized traffic control, real-time vehicle detection, and enhanced urban mobility. The system analyzes live traffic data, predicts traffic patterns, and dynamically adjusts traffic signals to reduce congestion.

**Features**
**#I-driven Backend:** Utilizes AI models to analyze traffic data and predict patterns.
Signal Control Module: Embedded software for real-time traffic signal management based on AI predictions.
Mobile/Web Interface: User-friendly mobile/web application to visualize traffic status, vehicle counts, and predictions.
Cloud Integration: Secure cloud infrastructure to store and analyze traffic data.
**Key Components**
Traffic Image Classification: AI-based image processing to count vehicles and analyze traffic congestion.
Real-time Data: Collects real-time traffic data via sensors or cameras.
Traffic Signal Control: Dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time traffic conditions.
Graph Visualization: Visual representation of traffic flow and vehicle counts for better decision-making.
Technologies Used
AI & Machine Learning: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
Backend: Flask/Django for API development
